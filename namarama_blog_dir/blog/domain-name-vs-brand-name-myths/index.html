<h1>Domain Name vs Brand Name myths</h1>
<h2>Artikel voor .com website</h2>
<p>Many people still think that a domain name and a company name are the same thing. Or that if you have claimed a domain name, you are entitled to that name.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that is not the case. You must register a company name with the Chamber of Commerce, and if you want to have rights to it, you must register the name with your local trademark office.</p>
<p>The other side of the story is that many people immediately consider the name they have come up with to be lost when they see that the .com domain name is already taken. What a shame! Because there are many alternatives to consider:</p>
<p>Change the domain name by adding “weare” or “thisis” in front of it. (weareName.com)</p>
<p>Change the domain name by changing a letter in the name (for example: Markt becomes Marqt).</p>
<p>Use an alternative extension, such as .online, .agency, .xyz, and there are many more possibilities</p>
<p>Domains such as .ai have also become extremely popular, mainly because artificial intelligence is becoming increasingly influential. Meanwhile, familiar extensions such as .nl and .be remain as popular as ever, because local companies prefer to stay close to home (according to research by the Global Domain Report, conducted by Sedo).</p>
<p>In addition, local and city-oriented domains are gaining ground. Whether you live in Amsterdam, Tokyo or Berlin, you increasingly see domain names that tell you exactly where you are. It's like a digital business card, but one that immediately impresses your neighbours and your customers.</p>
<p>In short, 2025 will be the year in which names become more personal, more creative and, hopefully, more fun.</p>
